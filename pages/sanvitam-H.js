                <strong>Sanvitam-H</strong> is a powerful multivitamin and mineral feed supplement formulated to enhance milk production, udder health, and overall vitality in cattle and poultry. Enriched with essential nutrients like Vitamin A, D3, E, Biotin (H), Vitamin C, B12, Zinc, Selenium, Copper, and Cobalt, Sanvitam-H supports the full development of milk-producing cells, strengthens udder tissues, and improves milk secretion and retention.

The supplement improves the taste and nutritional quality of milk while also enhancing animal immunity and metabolic functions. With consistent use, it provides visible results in udder firmness, milk yield, and overall lactation performance.
